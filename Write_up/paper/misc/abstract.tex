In this work we describe how to implement a powerful Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) inference algorithm, that being Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), for a First Order Probabilistic Programing Language (FOPPL). We implement a compiler that transforms the program specified in a FOPPL, into Python code, to take advantage of the automatic differentiation package in the Python library Pytorch. We give examples of FOPPL programs, the compiler output and provide results of the HMC inference on those programs.
